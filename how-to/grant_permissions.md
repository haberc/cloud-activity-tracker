## Granting IAM permisisons
{: #grant_iam_policy}

To grant a user an IAM role, consider the following information:

* When you define a policy, the regions that you specify define the regions where a user is granted access to view account domain events.

Complete the following steps to grant a user permissions to view events from an account domain:

1. Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.

    Open a web browser and launch the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard: [http://bluemix.net ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://bluemix.net){:new_window}
	
	After you log in with your user ID and password, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI opens.

2. From the menu bar, click **Manage > Account > Users**. 

    The *Users* window displays a list of users with their email addresses for the currently selected account.
	
3. If the user is a member of the account, select the user name from the list, or click **Manage user** from the *Actions* menu.

    If the user is not a member of the account, see [Inviting users](/docs/iam?topic=iam-iamuserinv#iamuserinv).

4. In the **Access policies** section, click **Assign access**, then select **Assign access to resources**.

    The *Assign resource access to user** window opens.

		<td>*IBM Cloud Log Analysis*</td>
	  </tr>	  
	  <tr>
	    <td>Regions</td>
		<td>You can specify the regions where the user is going to be granted access to work with events. Select one or more regions individually, or select **All current regions** to grant access to all regions.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Service instance</td>
		<td>Select *All service instances*.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Roles</td>
		<td>Select one or more IAM roles. <br>Valid roles are: *administrator*, *operator*, *editor*, and *viewer*.</td>
