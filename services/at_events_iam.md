# IAM events
{: #at_events}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailfull}} service to track how users and applications interact with the {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM) service in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}. 
{:shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} service records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. For more information, see [About {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}}](/docs/services/cloud-activity-tracker?topic=cloud-activity-tracker-activity_tracker_ov#activity_tracker_ov ).

To get started monitoring your user's actions, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailfull_notm}}](/docs/services/cloud-activity-tracker?topic=cloud-activity-tracker-getting-started-with-cla#getting-started-with-cla). 

An initiator can be a user, a service, or an application.
